## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?  
   
  -Wise (formerly TransferWise) was founded to address several key financial challenges:

  1. **High Fees on International Transfers**: Traditional banks and money transfer services often charge high fees for international transfers. These fees can include service charges, exchange rate markups, and sometimes hidden fees that are not disclosed upfront.

  2. **Unfavorable Exchange Rates**: Banks and traditional money transfer services often do not offer the interbank exchange rate (the rate banks use when they exchange money with each other) to their customers. Instead, they add a markup to the exchange rate, which can make international transfers more expensive for customers.

  3. **Slow Transfer Speeds**: International money transfers can sometimes take several days to complete using traditional banking channels. This can be a significant inconvenience for both individuals and businesses that need to transfer money quickly.

  4. **Lack of Transparency**: Traditional banks and money transfer services often lack transparency in their fee structures, making it difficult for customers to know exactly how much they are being charged and what exchange rate is being used.

   -Wise addressed these challenges by providing a platform that offers:

   1. **Lower Fees**: Wise charges a small, transparent fee for international transfers, which is often significantly lower than the fees charged by banks and traditional money transfer services.

   2. **Real Exchange Rate**: Wise uses the real, interbank exchange rate for all its transfers, without any markup.
   
   3. **Faster Transfers**: Wise's innovative technology and network of bank accounts around the world often make it possible to complete international transfers more quickly than traditional methods.

   4. **Transparency**: Wise is transparent about its fees and the exchange rate used for each transfer. Customers can see exactly how much they will be charged and what exchange rate will be used before they make a transfer.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
 
  -Wise (formerly TransferWise) has a broad customer base as it provides services that are valuable to both individuals and businesses:

  1. **Individuals**: For individuals who need to send money abroad, whether it's to family or friends, or for paying bills or expenses in another country, Wise offers a cheaper and more transparent alternative to traditional banks or money transfer services. This includes expatriates, international students, and anyone else who needs to manage money in multiple currencies. The freelance economy is also substantial and growing. According to a study by Upwork, there were 59 million freelancers in the US alone in 2020, and many of them work with international clients.

  2. **Businesses**: Wise is also popular among small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and freelancers who need to pay suppliers, employees, or contractors abroad, or receive payments from international clients. They offer a business account that comes with additional features tailored to the needs of businesses, such as the ability to make batch payments, integration with accounting software, and the ability to receive payments in multiple currencies. There are millions of SMBs around the world, many of which engage in international trade and therefore need to make and receive payments in foreign currencies. According to a report by the World Bank Group, over 90% of the businesses worldwide are SMEs

  3. **Online Sellers**: Online sellers and e-commerce businesses that receive payments in different currencies can benefit from Wise's multi-currency account and competitive exchange rates.
